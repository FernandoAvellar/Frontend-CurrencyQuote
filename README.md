# Welcome to My Currency Conversion App (Frontend)

The idea of this project was to implement a frontend in NextJs/React in order to consume a backend created to allow us to fetch currency conversion in real time.

> **Note:** The possible conversions are only to the currency **Brazilian Real (BRL).**

To test the project, follow the steps below:

- Run *git clone*
- Navigate to the *cloned-directory*
- Run command: *npm install*
- Run command: **npm run dev*
- Navigate to the URL: http://localhost:3000
- Create a new user using the button **Register**
- Login using the create user.

**There is an initial admin user in order to allow complete software validations check (User: admin / Password: 123)**
**For this project works you need before to have the backend below running.**
